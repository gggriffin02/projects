# PlatedApp

## Description
PlatedApp is a recipe and meal planning app designed to make cooking fun, social, and accessible. By focusing on user-centered design, the app allows users to discover and share recipes, manage their pantry, and receive curated recommendations tailored to their preferences and ingredients on hand. This project was developed as part of Stanford University's **CS147: Human-Computer Interaction** course.

## Design Evolution
The design process followed iterative refinement based on user feedback:
1. **Low-Fi Prototypes:**
   - Created initial sketches to explore app flows and features.
   - Usability testing revealed the need for a clear home screen and intuitive navigation.

2. **Medium-Fi Prototypes:**
   - Developed in Figma with a focus on visual aesthetics and user interactions.
   - Incorporated feedback from heuristic evaluations and industry experts.

3. **High-Fi Prototype:**
   - Built in React Native with nearly all intended features implemented.
   - Features like Chef Su were partially simulated to illustrate their functionality.
