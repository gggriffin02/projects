# Fresh Air for Indiana Mothers: The Hidden Economic Benefit of Closing Coal-Fired Power Plants

## Description
This paper quantifies the localized economic and health benefits of closing coal-fired power plants in Indiana, focusing on the impact on **infant mortality rates**. With Indiana historically dependent on coal for energy, this research explores how transitioning away from coal combustion can improve public health outcomes and provide economic benefits. The study employs a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** analysis to estimate the reduction in infant mortality rates associated with coal plant closures between 2013 and 2020.

## Key Findings
1. **Impact on Infant Mortality**:
   - An **8.8% decrease** in infant mortality rates in counties within 30 miles of coal plant closures.
   - Considering gestation periods, the reduction grows to **11.8%**, saving an estimated **26 to 230 infant lives annually**.

2. **Economic Value**:
   - Using the Environmental Protection Agency's **Value of Statistical Life (VSL)**, the benefits of these closures are estimated between **$189 million and $1.7 billion** in 2017 alone.

3. **Limitations**:
   - High variability in pollution dispersion (spillover effects).
   - Delayed health benefits due to gestation periods and long-term pollution exposure.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources**: County Health Rankings, coal plant closure records, and government health statistics.
- **Empirical Strategy**:
   - Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model comparing counties with and without coal plant closures.
   - Robustness checks including placebo tests on unrelated variables (e.g., income trends).

## Policy Implications
This research supports the case for accelerating coal plant closures by quantifying their health and economic benefits. Policymakers should:
1. Consider infant health improvements and economic savings in environmental policy decisions.
2. Weigh the benefits of early coal plant retirements despite regulatory hurdles.
