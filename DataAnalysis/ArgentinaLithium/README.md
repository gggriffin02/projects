# US-China Competition in the Lithium Triangle: Geopolitical Risks and the Impact on Lithium Investment Flows

## Description
This paper examines how US-China geopolitical tensions influence foreign direct investment (FDI) in **Argentina’s lithium sector**, a critical component of the global energy transition. Using a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** approach, it highlights the role of geopolitical rivalry in driving FDI into Argentina's strategic lithium industry post-2020.

## Key Findings
1. **FDI Growth Amid Geopolitical Tensions**:
   - A **59.78% relative increase** in FDI in Argentina’s lithium sector following the 2020 US-China trade war.

2. **Strategic Observations**:
   - US firms face higher sensitivity to market volatility compared to Chinese firms, which leverage vertical integration.
   - Argentina’s liberalized lithium policy underlines its strategic importance for global FDI trends.

3. **Policy Recommendations**:
   - **Establish a Strategic Investment Monitoring Unit**: Track investment flows and mitigate risks from geopolitical shocks.
   - **Encourage Value-Added Lithium Projects**: Offer tax incentives to promote local lithium-ion battery manufacturing.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources**:
   - Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR), Argentina's Central Bank, and Energy Information Administration (EIA).
- **Empirical Strategy**:
   - Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model comparing mining FDI to non-strategic FDI pre- and post-2020.
   - Lagged regression analysis to account for delayed effects of geopolitical risk.

---

## Policy Implications
1. Encourage **vertical integration** within the lithium sector to reduce reliance on raw material exports.
2. Develop **countercyclical tax policies** to stabilize mining investments during geopolitical shifts.

---

## Future Research
To build on these findings, future studies should:
1. Conduct cross-country analyses within the Lithium Triangle.
2. Investigate investor behavior under fluctuating geopolitical risks.
3. Refine modeling frameworks to incorporate factors like local infrastructure and corporate strategies.
